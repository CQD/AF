## What is AF Framework

AF Framework is a light weight PHP framework that enables you to build anything in any way you like.

Modern PHP frameworks are often pretty fat, and too large to put into a single repository, that's not the case for AF Framework. AF is designed to be minimalistic. Without the extra weight, it is very efficient and fast. On an average machine it should be able to handle thousands of request per second, if not more.

And the minimalistic design also helps to make the learning curve more confortable to newcomers, rookie engineers, and even those just want to learn the right way to do PHP.

Because AF use the least language feature as possible, it is also possible to adapt it to an older enviroment, makes it easier to modernize legacy product.
